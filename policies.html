    <h2>Academic Policies</h2>
    <p>
      While we endeavor to seek academic excellence, we subscribe to the Ministry of Education minimum passing grade of 70%. However, we encourage students to strive for higher marks by regularly recognizing and rewarding gifts or promotion.
      Students who maintain 95% average from first period through the first semester will be promoted to the next class except where the student is in the highest class of the school.
      A student failing in one subject in the average for the year will be promoted under condition and is compelled to attend enrichment classes but will still have to be monitored during the first period in the new class.
      A student failing in two (2) or more subjects repeats the class.
